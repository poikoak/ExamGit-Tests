I
find
it
easier
to
solve
my

problems
watching
the
play
I
understand
my

better
I
am
grateful
to

for

so
close

me
for
their
understand

and
support
There
are
differen
reach
the
highest
leaves
on
the
trees
that
other
animals
cannot
eat
It
s
a
well
known
fact
that
the
geographical
position
very
often
influences
the
climate
and
weather
of
any
country
The
United
States
is
no
exception
Here
the
Cascade
Mountains
and
the
Sierra
Nevada
Mountains
due
to
their
being
close
to
the
west
coast
catch
the
largest
share
of
the
rain
off
the
Pacific
Ocean
As
a
result
there
is
too
little
rain
for
almost
the
whole
western
half
of
the
Unites
States
which
lies
in
the
rain
shadow
of
the
mountains
In
a
great
part
of
that
territory
farmers
must
depend
on
irrigation
water
from
the
snows
or
rains
One
of
the
most
important
geographic
boundaries
in
the
United
States
is
the
50
centimeter
rainfall
line
It
runs
north
and
south
almost
through
the
middle
of
the
country
East
of
the
line
farming
here
is
easy
and
the
population
is
relatively
large
West
of
the
line
you
can
find
man
made
irrigation
systems
dry
farming
and
grazing
There
are
fewer
people
living
here
West
of
the
RockyMountains
there
are
vast
areas
without
any
trees
In
this
part
of
the
country
are
the
deserts
which
receive
as
little
as
over
12
centimeters
of
rainfall
a
year
If
there
were
no
mountains
or
oceans
then
the
amount
of
the
heat
would
progress
from
north
to
south
Instead
there
are
all
kinds
of
unexpected
differences
in
climate
For
example
all
along
the
western
coast
the
temperature
changes
little
between
summer
and
winter
The
climate
along
the
northern
part
of
this
coast
is
similar
to
that
of
England
But
in
the
north
central
part
of
the
country
summer
and
winter
are
very
different
There
the
average
difference
between
July
and
January
is
36
degrees
centigrade
C
The
coldest
days
of
a
typical
January
day
may
be
40
degrees
C
and
the
hottest
July
day
may
be
45
degrees
C
In
the
eastern
part
of
the
United
States
the
difference
between
summer
and
winter
is
also
distinct
but
not
so
extreme
Near
the
southwestern
corner
of
the
country
the
climate
is
mild
and
spring
like
in
winter
The
variations
in
temperature
within
the
United
States
have
had
a
marked
effect
on
the
country
s
economy
and
living
standards
There
is
a
long
crop
growing
season
along
the
south
east
coast
where
cotton
is
a
principal
product
In
some
of
the
cooler
climates
or
in
climates
which
combine
coolness
and
humidity
people
grow
apples
wheat
and
corn
This
gives
the
United
States
a
large
variety
of
agricultural
products
